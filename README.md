# PREDICTION-OF-EARTH-QUAKE-FYP

This study focused on evaluating the performance of deep learning models in predicting the magnitude and depth of seismic events and comparing their effectiveness with traditional machine learning approaches. The deep learning models examined included Deep LSTM, GRU, and LSTM, while the traditional models included Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor. The findings of the study clearly demonstrated that GRU models outperformed traditional models in accuracy, as measured by the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

The results highlighted that deep learning techniques, particularly GRU models, excel at understanding the temporal and sequential characteristics of earthquake data, enabling more precise predictions of earthquake magnitudes and depths. In contrast, traditional models like Linear Regression and Random Forest struggled to capture these sequential patterns, resulting in higher prediction errors.

This research underscored the potential of deep learning models for earthquake prediction. Their application could significantly enhance forecasting accuracy, contributing to the development of more effective early warning systems. Such systems could improve decision-making processes and mitigate the impacts of disasters on vulnerable communities. The relatively low complexity of Deep LSTM and GRU models makes them ideal candidates for integration into earthquake forecasting systems, enabling the prediction of seismic activity with critical information for safety planning.

Overall, the study has demonstrated that deep learning models hold great promise for earthquake prediction, providing a valuable foundation for further research in this area. Future studies are encouraged to expand the database used for experiments, refine feature selection processes, and enhance interpretability measures for these models. Such advancements would increase their reliability and suitability for implementation in earthquake early warning systems.
